# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Investigation of open data from internet-based expressions and opinions could yield fascinating 
outcomes and bits of knowledge into the universe of popular feelings about any item, 
administration or identity. The blast of Web 2.0 has prompted expanded action in Podcasting,
Blogging, Tagging, Contributing to RSS, Social Bookmarking, and Social Networking.
Subsequently there has been a sudden increase of enthusiasm for individuals to mine 
these tremendous assets of information for suppositions. Sentiment analysis or 
Opinion Mining is mining of sentiment polarities from online social media. In this project we will talk about a procedure which permits use and understanding of twitter information for sentiment analysis. We perform several steps of text pre-processing, and then experiment with multiple classification mechanisms. Using a dataset of 50000 tweets and TFIDF features, we comparison the accuracy obtained using various classifiers for this task. 
We find that linear SVMs provide us the best accuracy results among the various classifiers tried.
Sentiment analysis classifier could be useful for many applications like market analysis 
of different features of a new product or public opinion for a new movibe
or speech by a political candidate.
